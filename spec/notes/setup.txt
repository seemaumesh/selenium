Set Up
1 Linux box set up in AWS/EC2 resource
2 select instance to connect to an instance (details of a machine) which has the ip address
3 copy the ssh-i from the connect screen
2 You have set up a docker (set up env with LInux OS) by connecting to that instance/comntainer
3 Search for terminal and then copy the ssh-i link into terminal as a command
4 The command will execute a public key priv key handshake, it means, authentication
5 Start the docker by running command line” docker- compose up -d”
Note: -d is to enable background running of commands, in the front we can work on different things
this will set up the grid which has hub and nodes

Code function
1 In EC2 check the ip address 
2 In the script create webdriver that uses the ipaddress (13.236.194.226) of a machine and port (4444),to recognise where selenium server or hub is 
sitting in the env
3 copy the ipaddress in code to define the selenium server location hardcoded in JSON file or .config file. In this case new ipaddress 
is issued by aws
4 define the browser name
5 once chrome is launched get google.com by typing the link
6 Find an element by selecting inspect on that page or F12 
7 enter wait timing for 1000 secs
8 make sure === is used to make sure that you know what you are doing and what value you need to be fetched back
Note: if == is used system will use the command fr compare
9 In the code tell the driver to quit and end the program
10 In the command area in the bottom run Jas script by running command “node script name.js”
